# SSHReboot
Just a small script to reboot machines connected through ssh

It uses AutoHotKey, but you can also just use the exe if you don't want to change it or see what it does.

To insert your ip address and password you need to modify the sshIP.txt EX: 192.168.1.1, password

Remember that the txt and exe MUST BE in the same directory for the script to work

Also you need this installed on your machine https://www.howtogeek.com/336775/how-to-enable-and-use-windows-10s-built-in-ssh-commands/
